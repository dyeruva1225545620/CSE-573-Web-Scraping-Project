,1134,77,The armies of people who make clothes for Western brands‚Äîsome of the lowest-paid factory workers in the world‚Äîare protesting for better wages a sign that the era of ultracheap labor and ultracheap clothes on which many companies rely is increasingly under strain.‚Å†‚Å†Garment workers in Bangladesh make as little as $3 a day or about $75 a month. In recent days tens of thousands have refused to work calling for the minimum wage to be raised to nearly three times that amount. Demonstrations have spiraled with factories set ablaze and machines smashed. Some three hundred factories stopped operations.‚Å†‚Å†Sewing operator Hamim Shikder who joined protests said the roughly $125 a month he earns‚Äîafter 50 hours of overtime‚Äîis spent on his son‚Äôs school fees increasingly expensive groceries and other essentials. When his wife recently got sick with dengue he had to borrow money for medical bills. ‚ÄúWhatever amount I get I have to spend‚Äù he said.‚Å†‚Å†The core of the protests that workers need higher wages to make even a basic living has drawn widespread support including from fashion giants H&M Gap and Zara-parent Inditex which source from the country. But no one can agree on who should foot the bill.‚Å†‚Å†Factory owners in Bangladesh say that for them to hike wages in a big way Western brands that are their top buyers need to pay more for clothes. Although the big names in fashion publicly support higher pay in practice they balk when costs go up and threaten to shift their orders to other countries said Faruque Hassan president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.‚Å†‚Å†Western brands say they support a boost in Bangladesh‚Äôs minimum wage but most haven‚Äôt said by how much. Workers sewing clothes for them often make substantially more than the minimum wage but far less than what unions are demanding and what international organizations that benchmark living-wage standards consider to be enough.‚Å†‚Å†Read more at the link in our bio.‚Å†‚Å†Photo: Anik Rahman/Bloomberg News,
,1816,119,The U.S. has a lot of problems that desperately need solving. These aren‚Äôt Republican or Democratic challenges. They are American challenges. They affect every one of us and we need to face them together writes @joemanchin for @wsjopinion.There are enough votes in Congress to solve or at least make headway against every one of these problems. A genuine commitment to legislating would put America on firmer footing for the next 20 years. But the Democratic and Republican machines have no interest in solutions. Instead they stoke outrage because doing so brings them fame and funding.Today the business of politics is about monetizing anger and getting paid for it. And business has never been better. Not for me.I have made one of the toughest decisions of my life and decided that I won‚Äôt run for re-election to the Senate. I am proud of having worked every day of the past 42 years trying to make things better in the Mountain State. But this moment in the nation‚Äôs history is so filled with peril and political dysfunction that I want to work not only for my beloved West Virginia but for all Americans. Working together I want to eliminate what is standing in the way of so many obvious and popular solutions.While the Democratic and Republican parties increasingly cater to the extremes most Americans are moderate levelheaded folks and they are plain worn out. We need to reaffirm that country should always come before party.Read more at the link in @wsjopinion‚Äôs bio.Photo: Anna Rose Layden/Bloomberg News,

,1665,209,Hundreds of thousands of migrants from all over the world are making their way to the Southwest U.S. border with American and Mexican authorities reporting a surge in apprehensions of people from Asia and Africa as human smuggling networks widen their reach across the globe.‚Å†‚Å†Arrests at the Southwest U.S. border of migrants from China India and other distant countries including Mauritania and Senegal tripled to 214000 during the fiscal year that ended in September from 70000 in the previous fiscal year according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Fewer than 19000 migrants from Asia and Africa were apprehended in the fiscal year ended September 2021.‚Å†‚Å†‚ÄúThese days we are dealing with 120 nationalities and 60 different languages‚Äù said Enrique Lucero head of the migrant support unit of the Tijuana city government across from San Diego.‚Å†‚Å†Travelers say they exchange information and share videos of U.S.-bound routes on Tik Tok and Facebook while smugglers offer lodging and travel agencies advertise transport services. Most Asian and African migrants make multiple airport stopovers in what are coming to be known as ‚Äúdonkey flights‚Äù to reach countries such as Brazil Ecuador or Nicaragua which have few or no visa requirements for some nationalities. Once they set foot in Latin America they move north in buses or cars and stay at hotels booked by smuggling organizations.‚Å†‚Å†For the second year in a row arrests by the Border Patrol at the U.S. Southern border surpassed two million. Most of them almost nine out of 10 apprehensions are of migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. But the surge in so-called extracontinental migrants poses a challenge for the U.S. because deporting migrants to Africa and Asia is time-consuming expensive and sometimes not possible.‚Å†‚Å†Read m ore at the link in our bio.‚Å†‚Å†Photo: Roberto Cisneros/AFP/Getty Images,

,4300,532,As Hamas launched its deadly assault on Israel nearly a month ago the mastermind of the Islamist militant group‚Äôs attacks incited Arab citizens of Israel to ‚Äúkill burn and destroy‚Äù their Jewish neighbors.‚Å†‚Å†Instead Awad Darawshe helped those wounded in Hamas‚Äôs violent rampage. ‚ÄúIt cost him his life‚Äù said his sister Raya Darawshe.‚Å†‚Å†The 23-year-old Arab citizen of Israel was working as a medic at an all-night music festival in southern Israel on the morning Hamas militants broke out of the Gaza Strip killing 1400 people and taking more than 240 others hostage.‚Å†‚Å†While terrified revelers fled Darawshe stayed to treat the victims and was shot by Hamas becoming one of more than a dozen Arabs who were killed or captured in the wide-scale attacks.‚Å†‚Å†Their deaths illustrate the dilemma facing members of the country‚Äôs Arab minority as war between Israel and Hamas pulls them between their country and their kin. ‚Å†‚Å†Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were driven from their homes during the war that erupted upon the creation of the state of Israel in 1948. Those who remained and their descendants‚Äîcolloquially called ‚Äô48 Arabs‚Äîmake up about 20% of the population and are dubbed Arab-Israelis by the state. They have largely sought integration in Israel and enjoy equal rights on paper but many say they feel like second-class citizens.‚Å†‚Å†‚ÄúWhenever there is a war or anything it comes back against us as ‚Äô48 Arabs‚Äù said Darawshe‚Äôs sister.‚Å†‚Å†The backlash demonstrates the fragile standing of Israel‚Äôs sizable Arab population‚Äîa group that says it is being found guilty by association even while counting its members among victims of Hamas‚Äôs horrifying attack. ‚Å†‚Å†Read more at the link in our bio.‚Å†‚Å†üì∑: @habjouqa / NOOR Images for @wsjphotos,

,1941,277,On the wall of the border crossing between bombed-out Gaza and Egypt‚Äôs Sinai desert there is a list. The names on it have been a source of hope despair and confusion for the hundreds of foreign families wanting to escape the Palestinian enclave under Israeli fire.‚Å†‚Å†American sisters Jana and Mena Timraz rejoiced when their names appeared on the list on Thursday. But their parents brothers and Jana‚Äôs husband who aren‚Äôt U.S. citizens were missing from the roster. ‚ÄúMy husband said ‚ÄòGo save yourself and son‚Äîthat‚Äôs the most important thing‚Äô‚Äù recalls Jana cradling her 3-month-old son in a hotel in Cairo having left the rest of her family behind in Gaza.‚Å†‚Å†Their story is among the tales of heart-rending dilemmas and bureaucratic hurdles emerging from those fleeing Gaza in the past few days. After a weekslong diplomatic wrangle to get the frontier open for foreign nationals and the injured the task of choosing who goes through is arguably more arduous.‚Å†‚Å†The exodus was complicated further by the suspension of crossings on Saturday morning when Hamas the U.S.-designated terror organization that runs the Gaza Strip said it wouldn‚Äôt open the border unless Israel agreed to the safe passage of ambulances heading to the crossing. An ambulance near the largest hospital in Gaza City was struck Friday by the Israelis who said they were targeting Hamas militants using the vehicle. The border opened again on Monday.‚Å†‚Å†About 60 different nations have asked Egypt for around 7600 foreign nationals‚Äîmany of Palestinian heritage‚Äîto be allowed to leave Gaza according to senior Egyptian officials. Among them are between 500 and 600 Americans. In its first three days of operation some 1027 dual nationals went through the crossing. On Saturday though departures dried up altogether before being restored on Monday when 329 civilians went through. The Hamas-run Palestinian border authority didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.‚Å†‚Å†Read more at the link in our bio.‚Å†‚Å†üì∑: @sima_diab for @wsjphotos,
